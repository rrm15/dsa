# dsa

final year engineering student here. this repo is me going through data structures and algorithms from scratch in c. no frameworks, no libraries, no hand-holding. just raw c code, manual memory management, and a lot of segfaults along the way.

the goal is to actually understand how things work under the hood before i graduate and mass apply to jobs that ask me to reverse a linked list on a whiteboard.

nothing fancy. just the fundamentals.
